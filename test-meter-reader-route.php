echo "🔧 Water Meter Reader Route Fix\n";
echo "===============================\n\n";

echo "✅ Issue Identified:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "Missing GET route for /api/water-meter-readers\n";
echo "Only POST route existed for adding meter readers\n";
echo "No route to retrieve all meter readers\n\n";

echo "🔧 What was added:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-meter-readers route\n";
echo "✅ getMeterReaders() method in controller\n";
echo "✅ getMeterReaders() method in repository\n";
echo "✅ Returns all meter readers with relationships\n\n";

echo "📋 Available Routes:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-meter-readers (all meter readers)\n";
echo "✅ POST /api/water-meter-readers (add meter reader)\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-schemes/{id}/meter-readers (by scheme)\n\n";

echo "📋 Repository Method:\n";
echo "====================\n";
echo "✅ Returns all WaterMeterReader records\n";
echo "✅ Includes officer and waterScheme relationships\n";
echo "✅ Returns JSON response with meter_readers array\n\n";

echo "🎯 Expected Results:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-meter-readers → 200 OK\n";
echo "✅ Returns: {\"meter_readers\": [...]}\n";
echo "✅ Each meter reader includes officer and waterScheme data\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test the Fix:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "1. Try getting meter readers from the frontend\n";
echo "2. The 405 error should be resolved\n";
echo "3. Check that meter readers are returned with relationships\n";
echo "4. Verify the response shows all meter readers\n\n";

echo "✅ Meter reader route fix applied!\n";
echo "The GET endpoint for meter readers should work perfectly now.\n";
