echo "🧪 Debugging Water Scheme Permissions\n";
echo "=====================================\n\n";

echo "🔍 To debug the 403 error, please:\n\n";

echo "1. Check your user's role and permissions:\n";
echo "   GET /api/water-schemes?debug=1\n";
echo "   (This will show your current user info and permissions)\n\n";

echo "2. Check the Laravel logs:\n";
echo "   Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 20\n";
echo "   (Look for 'Water scheme creation attempt' entries)\n\n";

echo "3. Verify your user has the correct role:\n";
echo "   - Admin role: Should have all water-schemes permissions\n";
echo "   - OfficerWaterBill role: Should have all water-schemes permissions\n";
echo "   - Regular Officer role: Should only have read permission\n\n";

echo "4. Check if the user is authenticated:\n";
echo "   - Make sure you're sending the Authorization header\n";
echo "   - Format: 'Bearer your-token-here'\n\n";

echo "5. Common issues:\n";
echo "   ❌ User doesn't have the correct role assigned\n";
echo "   ❌ Authentication token is missing or invalid\n";
echo "   ❌ User is not logged in\n";
echo "   ❌ Permissions haven't been applied to the user\n\n";

echo "🔧 Quick fixes to try:\n";
echo "1. Re-assign the user to the correct role\n";
echo "2. Clear and regenerate the authentication token\n";
echo "3. Check if the user is properly authenticated\n";
echo "4. Verify the user has the officerwaterbill or admin role\n\n";

echo "📋 Expected permissions for each role:\n";
echo "Admin: water-schemes.read, water-schemes.create, water-schemes.update, water-schemes.delete\n";
echo "OfficerWaterBill: water-schemes.read, water-schemes.create, water-schemes.update, water-schemes.delete\n";
echo "Officer: water-schemes.read only\n\n";

echo "✅ Debug information ready!\n";
echo "Use the debug endpoint to check your user's current permissions.\n\n";
