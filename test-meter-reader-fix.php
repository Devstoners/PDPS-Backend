echo "🔧 Water Meter Reader Fix\n";
echo "=========================\n\n";

echo "✅ Issue Identified:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "Database schema mismatch:\n";
echo "- Database has: user_id\n";
echo "- Model was using: officer_id\n";
echo "- Frontend sends: officer_id\n\n";

echo "🔧 What was fixed:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "✅ Updated model fillable: user_id instead of officer_id\n";
echo "✅ Updated repository: maps officer_id to user_id\n";
echo "✅ Updated relationship: uses user_id for officer relationship\n\n";

echo "📋 Database Fields:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "✅ id\n";
echo "✅ created_at\n";
echo "✅ updated_at\n";
echo "✅ user_id\n";
echo "✅ nic\n";
echo "✅ water_schemes_id\n\n";

echo "📋 Model Configuration:\n";
echo "=======================\n";
echo "✅ Fillable: user_id, water_schemes_id\n";
echo "✅ Relationship: officer() uses user_id\n";
echo "✅ Repository: maps officer_id → user_id\n\n";

echo "🎯 Expected Results:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "✅ POST /api/water-meter-readers → 200 OK\n";
echo "✅ Meter reader created successfully\n";
echo "✅ Response: {\"meter_reader\": {...}, \"message\": \"Meter reader assigned successfully\"}\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test the Fix:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "1. Try adding a meter reader from the frontend\n";
echo "2. The 500 error should be resolved\n";
echo "3. Check that the meter reader is created in database\n";
echo "4. Verify the response shows success message\n\n";

echo "✅ Meter reader fix applied!\n";
echo "The meter reader creation should work perfectly now.\n";
