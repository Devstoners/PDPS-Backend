echo "ðŸ’§ Updated Water Bill Calculation Logic\n";
echo "========================================\n\n";

echo "âœ… NEW TIERED PRICING STRUCTURE:\n";
echo "================================\n";
echo "ðŸ”¹ TIER 1: First 5 units (0-5)\n";
echo "   - Rate: units_0_1 (from water_bill_rates table)\n";
echo "   - Example: If units_0_1 = 15.50, then first 5 units cost 15.50 each\n\n";

echo "ðŸ”¹ TIER 2: Next 5 units (6-10)\n";
echo "   - Rate: units_1_5 (from water_bill_rates table)\n";
echo "   - Example: If units_1_5 = 25.00, then units 6-10 cost 25.00 each\n\n";

echo "ðŸ”¹ TIER 3: Above 10 units (11+)\n";
echo "   - Rate: units_above_5 (from water_bill_rates table)\n";
echo "   - Example: If units_above_5 = 35.00, then units 11+ cost 35.00 each\n\n";

echo "ðŸ”¹ SERVICE CHARGE: Fixed amount\n";
echo "   - Rate: service (from water_bill_rates table)\n";
echo "   - Example: If service = 100.00, then 100.00 is added to every bill\n\n";

echo "ðŸ§® UPDATED CALCULATION ALGORITHM:\n";
echo "=================================\n";
echo "```php\n";
echo "private function calculateBillAmount(\$unitsConsumed, \$billRate)\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "    \$totalAmount = 0;\n";
echo "    \n";
echo "    // Tier 1: First 5 units (0-5)\n";
echo "    if (\$unitsConsumed > 0) {\n";
echo "        \$tier1Units = min(\$unitsConsumed, 5);\n";
echo "        \$totalAmount += \$tier1Units * \$billRate->units_0_1;\n";
echo "    }\n";
echo "    \n";
echo "    // Tier 2: Next 5 units (6-10)\n";
echo "    if (\$unitsConsumed > 5) {\n";
echo "        \$tier2Units = min(\$unitsConsumed - 5, 5);\n";
echo "        \$totalAmount += \$tier2Units * \$billRate->units_1_5;\n";
echo "    }\n";
echo "    \n";
echo "    // Tier 3: Above 10 units (11+)\n";
echo "    if (\$unitsConsumed > 10) {\n";
echo "        \$tier3Units = \$unitsConsumed - 10;\n";
echo "        \$totalAmount += \$tier3Units * \$billRate->units_above_5;\n";
echo "    }\n";
echo "    \n";
echo "    // Add service charge (fixed amount)\n";
echo "    \$totalAmount += \$billRate->service;\n";
echo "    \n";
echo "    return \$totalAmount;\n";
echo "}\n";
echo "```\n\n";

echo "ðŸ“Š UPDATED CALCULATION EXAMPLES:\n";
echo "=================================\n\n";

echo "Example 1: 3 units consumed\n";
echo "---------------------------\n";
echo "Tier 1: 3 units Ã— 15.50 = 46.50\n";
echo "Service: + 100.00\n";
echo "Total: 46.50 + 100.00 = 146.50\n\n";

echo "Example 2: 8 units consumed\n";
echo "---------------------------\n";
echo "Tier 1: 5 units Ã— 15.50 = 77.50\n";
echo "Tier 2: 3 units Ã— 25.00 = 75.00\n";
echo "Service: + 100.00\n";
echo "Total: 77.50 + 75.00 + 100.00 = 252.50\n\n";

echo "Example 3: 15 units consumed\n";
echo "----------------------------\n";
echo "Tier 1: 5 units Ã— 15.50 = 77.50\n";
echo "Tier 2: 5 units Ã— 25.00 = 125.00\n";
echo "Tier 3: 5 units Ã— 35.00 = 175.00\n";
echo "Service: + 100.00\n";
echo "Total: 77.50 + 125.00 + 175.00 + 100.00 = 477.50\n\n";

echo "ðŸ”„ TIER BREAKDOWN:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "Units 0-5:   Tier 1 rate (units_0_1)\n";
echo "Units 6-10:  Tier 2 rate (units_1_5)\n";
echo "Units 11+:   Tier 3 rate (units_above_5)\n";
echo "All bills:   + Service charge\n\n";

echo "ðŸŽ¯ KEY CHANGES:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "âœ… Tier 1: Changed from 0-1000 to 0-5 units\n";
echo "âœ… Tier 2: Changed from 1001-5000 to 6-10 units\n";
echo "âœ… Tier 3: Changed from 5001+ to 11+ units\n";
echo "âœ… More granular pricing structure\n";
echo "âœ… Better for smaller consumption patterns\n\n";

echo "âœ… Updated water bill calculation logic implemented!\n";
echo "The new tiered structure is now active for all meter readings.\n";
