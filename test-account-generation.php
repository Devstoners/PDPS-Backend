echo "🔧 Account Number Generation Logic Update\n";
echo "========================================\n\n";

echo "✅ Updated Logic:\n";
echo "=================\n";
echo "✅ Uses raw SQL query as specified\n";
echo "✅ Finds MAX account number for specific water scheme\n";
echo "✅ Extracts last 5 digits and converts to UNSIGNED\n";
echo "✅ Increments by 1 for next number\n";
echo "✅ Pads with leading zeros (00001, 00002, etc.)\n\n";

echo "📋 SQL Query Implementation:\n";
echo "==========================\n";
echo "SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(account_no, -5) AS UNSIGNED)) as last_number\n";
echo "FROM water_customers \n";
echo "WHERE water_schemes_id = {waterSchemeId}\n";
echo "AND account_no LIKE 'PS/PATHA/WATER/{waterSchemeId}/%'\n\n";

echo "🔧 Logic Flow:\n";
echo "==============\n";
echo "1. ✅ Check if water scheme exists\n";
echo "2. ✅ Execute SQL query to find highest number\n";
echo "3. ✅ If no records found, start with 1\n";
echo "4. ✅ If records found, increment by 1\n";
echo "5. ✅ Pad with leading zeros (5 digits)\n";
echo "6. ✅ Generate: PS/PATHA/WATER/{scheme_id}/{00001}\n\n";

echo "📋 Example Scenarios:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "Scenario 1 - No existing customers:\n";
echo "  → Returns: PS/PATHA/WATER/1/00001\n";
echo "  → next_number: 1, last_number: 0\n\n";

echo "Scenario 2 - Existing customers:\n";
echo "  → If highest is PS/PATHA/WATER/1/00005\n";
echo "  → Returns: PS/PATHA/WATER/1/00006\n";
echo "  → next_number: 6, last_number: 5\n\n";

echo "Scenario 3 - Multiple schemes:\n";
echo "  → Scheme 1: PS/PATHA/WATER/1/00003\n";
echo "  → Scheme 2: PS/PATHA/WATER/2/00001\n";
echo "  → Each scheme generates independently\n\n";

echo "🎯 API Response Format:\n";
echo "======================\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"account_number\": \"PS/PATHA/WATER/1/00006\",\n";
echo "  \"water_scheme_id\": 1,\n";
echo "  \"water_scheme_name\": \"Scheme Name\",\n";
echo "  \"next_number\": 6,\n";
echo "  \"last_number\": 5\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "1. Test with no existing customers\n";
echo "2. Test with existing customers\n";
echo "3. Test with multiple water schemes\n";
echo "4. Test with non-existent water scheme\n";
echo "5. Verify SQL query execution\n\n";

echo "✅ Account number generation logic updated!\n";
echo "The system now uses the exact SQL query you specified.\n";
