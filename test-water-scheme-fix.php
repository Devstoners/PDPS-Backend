echo "🧪 Testing Water Scheme Fix\n";
echo "==========================\n\n";

echo "✅ Issue Identified and Fixed:\n";
echo "==============================\n";
echo "The problem was duplicate water-schemes routes:\n";
echo "1. Old routes (lines 83-87) → WaterBillController (no permission middleware)\n";
echo "2. New routes (line 264-265) → WaterSchemeController (with permission middleware)\n\n";

echo "🔧 What was fixed:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "✅ Removed duplicate old routes pointing to WaterBillController\n";
echo "✅ Kept new routes pointing to WaterSchemeController with proper permissions\n";
echo "✅ Cleaned up debug code from controller\n\n";

echo "📋 Current Route Configuration:\n";
echo "==============================\n";
echo "GET    /api/water-schemes           → WaterSchemeController@index\n";
echo "POST   /api/water-schemes           → WaterSchemeController@store (with permission middleware)\n";
echo "GET    /api/water-schemes/{id}      → WaterSchemeController@show\n";
echo "PUT    /api/water-schemes/{id}     → WaterSchemeController@update\n";
echo "DELETE /api/water-schemes/{id}     → WaterSchemeController@destroy\n\n";

echo "🎯 Expected Results:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-schemes → 200 OK (with proper permissions)\n";
echo "✅ POST /api/water-schemes → 200 OK (with proper permissions)\n";
echo "✅ User with admin/officerwaterbill role can create water schemes\n";
echo "✅ User with officer role can only read water schemes\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test the Fix:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "1. Try creating a water scheme again from the frontend\n";
echo "2. The 403 error should be resolved\n";
echo "3. Users with admin/officerwaterbill roles should be able to create\n";
echo "4. Users with officer role should only be able to read\n\n";

echo "✅ Fix Applied Successfully!\n";
echo "The duplicate routes have been removed and the proper permission middleware is now active.\n";
