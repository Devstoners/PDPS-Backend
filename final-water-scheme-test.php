echo "✅ authorize() returns true\n";
echo "✅ location is nullable\n";
echo "✅ status is nullable (removed enum restriction)\n";
echo "✅ Default values set in controller\n";
echo "✅ Status validation in controller\n\n";

echo "1. Try creating a water scheme from the frontend\n";

echo "4. Should create water scheme successfully\n\n";

echo "🚨 If Still Getting 422:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "1. Restart Laravel server: php artisan serve\n";
echo "2. Clear browser cache\n";
echo "3. Check browser network tab for exact request data\n";
echo "4. Verify the frontend is sending the correct data\n\n";

echo "✅ All fixes applied!\n";
