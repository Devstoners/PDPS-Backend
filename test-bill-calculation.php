 * Test Bill Calculation Logic

echo "🔧 Bill Calculation Logic Implementation\n";
echo "========================================\n\n";

echo "✅ What was implemented:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "✅ Updated addMeterReading() to calculate bill amount\n";
echo "✅ Added calculateBillAmount() method with tiered pricing\n";
echo "✅ Automatic water bill creation on meter reading\n";
echo "✅ Integration with water_bill_rates table\n\n";

echo "📋 Tiered Pricing Structure:\n";
echo "============================\n";
echo "✅ Tier 1: First 1000 units (0-1000) → units_0_1 rate\n";
echo "✅ Tier 2: Next 4000 units (1001-5000) → units_1_5 rate\n";
echo "✅ Tier 3: Above 5000 units (5001+) → units_above_5 rate\n";
echo "✅ Service Charge: Fixed amount added once\n\n";

echo "🔧 Calculation Logic:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "✅ Calculate units consumed (current - previous reading)\n";
echo "✅ Get water customer's water scheme\n";
echo "✅ Find bill rates for the water scheme\n";
echo "✅ Apply tiered pricing calculation\n";
echo "✅ Add service charge\n";
echo "✅ Create water bill with calculated amount\n\n";

echo "📋 Bill Creation Process:\n";
echo "=========================\n";
echo "✅ water_customer_id from meter reading\n";
echo "✅ meter_reader_id from request (or default)\n";
echo "✅ billing_month from meter reading month\n";
echo "✅ due_date = billing_month + 30 days\n";
echo "✅ amount_due calculated using tiered pricing\n";
echo "✅ status = 1 (unpaid)\n\n";

echo "🎯 Example Calculations:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "Example 1: 500 units consumed\n";
echo "  - Tier 1: 500 units × units_0_1 rate\n";
echo "  - Service charge: + service amount\n";
echo "  - Total: (500 × rate) + service\n\n";

echo "Example 2: 2000 units consumed\n";
echo "  - Tier 1: 1000 units × units_0_1 rate\n";
echo "  - Tier 2: 1000 units × units_1_5 rate\n";
echo "  - Service charge: + service amount\n";
echo "  - Total: (1000 × rate1) + (1000 × rate2) + service\n\n";

echo "Example 3: 6000 units consumed\n";
echo "  - Tier 1: 1000 units × units_0_1 rate\n";
echo "  - Tier 2: 4000 units × units_1_5 rate\n";
echo "  - Tier 3: 1000 units × units_above_5 rate\n";
echo "  - Service charge: + service amount\n";
echo "  - Total: (1000 × rate1) + (4000 × rate2) + (1000 × rate3) + service\n\n";

echo "📋 API Response Format:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "POST /api/water-meter-readings:\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"reading\": {\n";
echo "    \"id\": 1,\n";
echo "    \"water_customer_id\": 1,\n";
echo "    \"units_consumed\": \"500.00\"\n";
echo "  },\n";
echo "  \"water_bill\": {\n";
echo "    \"id\": 1,\n";
echo "    \"water_customer_id\": 1,\n";
echo "    \"amount_due\": \"1250.00\",\n";
echo "    \"status\": 1\n";
echo "  },\n";
echo "  \"bill_amount\": 1250.00,\n";
echo "  \"units_consumed\": 500,\n";
echo "  \"message\": \"Meter reading recorded and water bill created successfully\"\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "1. Create meter reading with 500 units\n";
echo "2. Create meter reading with 2000 units\n";
echo "3. Create meter reading with 6000 units\n";
echo "4. Verify bill calculation accuracy\n";
echo "5. Check water bill creation\n";
echo "6. Test with different water schemes\n";
echo "7. Verify due date calculation\n\n";

echo "✅ Bill calculation logic implemented!\n";
echo "Automatic water bill creation with tiered pricing is now active.\n";
