echo "✅ deleteMeterReader() method in controller\n";
echo "✅ updateMeterReader() method in repository\n";
echo "✅ deleteMeterReader() method in repository\n\n";

echo "📋 Complete CRUD Routes:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-meter-readers (all meter readers)\n";
echo "✅ POST /api/water-meter-readers (add meter reader)\n";
echo "✅ PUT /api/water-meter-readers/{id} (update meter reader)\n";
echo "✅ DELETE /api/water-meter-readers/{id} (delete meter reader)\n";
