echo "✅ Getting 422 validation error (expected)\n\n";

echo "🔧 Validation Rules Updated:\n";
echo "============================\n";
echo "✅ name: required|string|max:255\n";
echo "✅ description: nullable|string|max:1000\n";
echo "✅ location: nullable|string|max:255 (was required)\n";
echo "✅ status: nullable|string|in:Active,Inactive,Under Maintenance (was required)\n";
echo "✅ capacity: nullable|numeric|min:0\n";
echo "✅ supply_area: nullable|string|max:255\n";

echo "🧪 Test the Fix:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "1. Try creating a water scheme from the frontend\n";
