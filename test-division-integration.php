 * Test Division Integration with Water Bill Rates
 */

echo "🔧 Division Integration with Water Bill Rates\n";
echo "============================================\n\n";

echo "✅ What was implemented:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "✅ Updated WaterBillRate model with division relationship\n";
echo "✅ Updated index method to include division_en\n";
echo "✅ Added GET /api/divisions/{divisionId} endpoint\n";
echo "✅ Added route for division details\n\n";

echo "📋 Model Relationships:\n";
echo "=======================\n";
echo "✅ WaterBillRate → WaterScheme (belongsTo)\n";
echo "✅ WaterScheme → Division (belongsTo)\n";
echo "✅ WaterBillRate → Division (hasOneThrough)\n\n";

echo "📋 Updated API Endpoints:\n";
echo "=========================\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-bill-rates - Now includes division_en\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/divisions/{divisionId} - Get division details\n";
echo "✅ GET /api/water-schemes - Get water schemes for dropdown\n\n";

echo "🎯 Expected API Response - GET /api/water-bill-rates:\n";
echo "====================================================\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"success\": true,\n";
echo "  \"message\": \"Water bill rates retrieved successfully\",\n";
echo "  \"data\": [\n";

echo "==========================================================\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"success\": true,\n";
echo "  \"message\": \"Division details retrieved successfully\",\n";
echo "  \"data\": {\n";
echo "    \"id\": 1,\n";

echo "    \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-30T...\"\n";
echo "  }\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "🔧 Relationship Logic:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "✅ WaterBillRate → waterScheme → division\n";
echo "✅ Uses hasOneThrough relationship\n";
echo "✅ Includes division_en in bill rates listing\n";
echo "✅ Separate endpoint for division details\n\n";

echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "1. List water bill rates with division_en\n";
echo "2. Get division details by ID\n";
echo "3. Verify relationship loading\n";
echo "4. Test error handling for non-existent division\n";
echo "5. Verify JSON response structure\n\n";

echo "📋 Database Structure:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "✅ divisions table:\n";
echo "  - id (int)\n";
echo "  - division_en (string)\n";
echo "  - division_si (string)\n";
echo "  - division_ta (string)\n";
echo "  - timestamps\n\n";

echo "✅ water_schemes table:\n";
echo "  - id (int)\n";
echo "  - division_id (int) → divisions.id\n";
echo "  - name (string)\n\n";

echo "✅ water_bill_rates table:\n";
echo "  - id (int)\n";
echo "  - water_schemes_id (int) → water_schemes.id\n";
echo "  - units_0_1, units_1_5, units_above_5, service (decimal)\n\n";

echo "✅ Division integration complete!\n";
echo "Water bill rates now include division_en information.\n";
